Week 3 Project:
We will be creating a small sample React app for our exercise this week. Create a new React app (follow the instructions
on the last slide for this week if you need a reminder), and our goal is to create a 'Quote of the Day' page.

Things that you will (probably) need:
1. Hold an array of quotes, and a current Index in state.
2. Two buttons with onClick functions

You can do this all in one file! (App.js)

If you finish early, you can try adding an input bar as well that allows a user to add input, adding
it to the default quote list.
