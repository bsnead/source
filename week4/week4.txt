Week 4 Project:
This week we learned about the parent/child relationship of components in React, as well as how to make 'get' requests with axios.
This week's exercise will be to create a React app with multiple components. We will be making a "To-Do" List,
where a user can input a task that they need to do, as well as a time it needs to be completed by. It will then be added
to a list that is displayed at the bottom of the page of tasks. To get a good grasp of multiple components, your App hierarchy should look like this:
        <App/>
        /    \
    <Inputs> <List/>

Things to look out for:

1. Since your input data needs to make it to the List component somehow, you will need to pass a 'callback' function
from App to List to update App's state.

2. App should be the 'Source (pun intended) of Truth' for all data: I suggest holding the tasks/end times in 
an array of objects in App state, and passing it down to the List component.

3. Since List will be receiving an array of objects, this is a great time to use the map function!
