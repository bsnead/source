Week 0 Project:

    Think of an application that could be useful for a new college student at UVA. Think of a problem that needs to be solved
    for first years at UVA! The goal of this exercise is to start thinking about the things that need to go into an app.
    Create a very rough wireframe of what the app interface would look like: you can either sketch this on paper or use a wireframe website (I recommend Marvel).
    It doesn't have to be super detailed, just enough to give an idea of how a user would interface with the app. After you have a 
    rough sketch, think of what tools you would need to build your application, and prepare a brief presentation on your idea in Google Slides. Here are some things to think about:

    1. What is the purpose of the website?
    2. Do I need to grab data from anywhere?
    3. Where would I want to store data?
    4. Do we want a mobile app or a typical website?
    5. Specific programming language(s) to use? (don't worry if you don't know any for this one)
    6. Would I want users to sign in, and how would I handle user authentication?

    The list above is just some things to think about-- you don't necessarily need to include every one, and are not limited to the list.
    Obviously, some of these topics you may not know a lot about, as we have only had about an hour of class time! Not to worry, we just
    want to see that you have given a couple topics some thought (google is certainly your friend here!)
    
What to submit:
    (working) link to a google doc filled in on this Google Sheets:
