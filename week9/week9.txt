Week 10 Project:

As we saw this week, when using a backend like Graphcool we can manipulate data a lot more easily, but it requires
more overhead. For this week's exercise, we are going to imagine that we are building a large scale e-commerce site that will
be handling a lot of data. The goal of this week's exercise is to sketch out the whole 'blueprint' for how data will be structured,
in Graphcool terms. 

Possible tables could include:

- regular users
- merchants
- payments
- item for sale
- item category (clothes, electronics, etc..)

Sketch out a list of 6-8 tables and any relationships that exist between them (one-to-one, one-to-many),
and note any restrictions that would need to be in place ( for example: an item for sale only has one seller).
Once you and your partner have worked out the tables, try to implement them in Graphcool. (Note we won't be having
a corresponding React component to this exercise because I know that setting up Graphcool and React take a long time!)
